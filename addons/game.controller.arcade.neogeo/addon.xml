        <description lang="en_GB">The controller for the Neo Geo AES (Advanced Entertainment System), a video game console released in the US in 1991. The Neo Geo AES was unique in that it was a niche system, marketed toward high-end consumers who wanted to play true arcade games in their home. The AES is merely a repackaged version of their Neo Geo MVS arcade system, where swappable games are stored on giant cartridges. The console was expensive, as were the games themselves, which could go for hundreds of dollars.</description>
