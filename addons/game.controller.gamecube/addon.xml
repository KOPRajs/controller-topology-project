        <description lang="en_GB">Released alongside the GameCube console, the standard GameCube controller has a wing grip design. This controller was bundled with all new GameCube systems throughout the consoles life cycle and was also available separately.  The standard GameCube controller provides haptic feedback by way of a built-in rumble motor rather than using an external Rumble Pak add-on like the Nintendo 64 controller. Also unlike its predecessor, this controller does not feature any expansion capabilities.  The controller features a total of six digital buttons, two analog sticks, a d-pad and two hybrid analog triggers/digital buttons.</description>
